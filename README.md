# git dojo ðŸ¥‹

Welcome to the git dojo! The goal of this dojo is for you to master some common day-to-day git commands, such as:
- `git reset HEAD~<N>`
- `git commit --amend`
- `git rebase --interactive`

Each set of command exercises has its own branch, namely:
- `git-reset-head`
- `git-commit-amend`
- `git-rebase-i`

**Do note** that this tutorial is supposed to be done ***exclusively from the command line***. No graphical tool is allowed.

## Setup

Fork the project from the command line:

1. in GitHub (or whichever git hosting service of choice), create a new project named Â« git-dojo Â»
1. `git clone https://github.com/cooptalis-gprst/git-dojo`
1. `cd git-dojo`
1. `git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/cooptalist-gprst/git-dojo`
1. `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your_username>/git-dojo`

Note that if you have an SSH key set up on GitHub, you could (and should) replace `https://github.com/<your_username>/git-dojo` with `git@github.com:<your_username>/git-dojo`.

Once done, you can checkout to the dojo branches with the following command:

```bash
git checkout --track upstream/<branch_name> # e.g. git checkout --track upstream/git-reset-head
git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name> # e.g. git push --set-upstream origin git-reset-head
```

Instructions will be in the README :)
