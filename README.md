# git commit --amend ‚úç

This command is to **edit the previous commit**. You can write some changes, and then put them in the previous commit without having to create new ones.

The **only commands you can use** are:

- `git commit --amend`
- `git commit --amend --no-edit`

You can also commit and force-push changes.

Read along for instructions.

## First exercise

Some files are already committed, with their name as content. Unfortunately, it appears some files have some weird content in it. You must **fix them** so that **every file only contains their name** (e.g. `file-1` must contain "file-1", `file-2` must contain "file-2", and so on).

By the end of this exercise, your commit history must still be:

1. README for `git commit --amend`
1. Add some files

## Second exercise

You actually want your commit history to be:

1. README for `git commit --amend`
1. Add some INCREDIBLE and MARVELOUS files

How would you do that?
